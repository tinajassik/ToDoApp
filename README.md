# ToDoApp
Basic Todo App (.NET)

Basic Todo Logic implemented based on the below user stories:

As a user of the system I can add a new User, so that Todos can be assigned to Users

As a User I can get a list of all existing Users, so that I can assign Todos to them

As a User I can add a new Todo, so that I can remember important things

As a User I can view all or filtered Todos, so that I can remember what to do

As a User I can complete a Todo, so that I can mark things as done

As a User I can delete a Todo, so that I can clean up
